<p>Trajan's Market, also known as Mercatus Traiani, is thought to have been built around 107-110 AD. It was a three-tiered building in the shape of a semi-circle. Aside from being a beautiful piece of Roman architecture, it was a place meant to harbor commerce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first level, on the ground, was wholly devoted to shops, which would be inside of arches that were facing out on the inside of the semi-circle. They would generally put things out front as a way of displaying them.<br /><br />The second level was mostly stairs but the third was meant for housing. Up there the merchants might stay when the shops are not open, and they would just come down to the shops when they needed to open.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Market would have been a bustling place, with merchants projecting their wares across the market and citizens browsing around for something they might fancy or something they may need.&nbsp;</p>
