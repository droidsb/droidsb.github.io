<p>  Chapter 1   There once was a dragon, which had taken treasures and jewels of great worth for itself&#8230; and, there once was a village. If you had happened upon this village on first look you would think it was a ruin, but hundreds of years ago it would have been a very populated village. If you were there a hundred years ago you would notice the high amount of gardens and trees. The people in this village loved nature, and most of the houses were a good distance from each other with trees and rivers running through the majority of them. But once you got closer to the middle of the town the house got nearer to each other, and in the heart of the town was a huge tree. This tree is bigger than any other tree you have ever seen. This village was called Winsington Creek, one of the most spectacular and most unvisited village in the world. In that village lived a boy, about 13 years in age. He went out one day in the village and he ran through a sweet smelling forest of pine trees, over a blue rushing creek, down a hill of the greenest grass you ever saw, and met his friend.  Char (short for Charlie) asked Sam what they were going to do that day. Sam said, &ldquo;We are in charge of the decorations for the Calamite festival. Its coming up you know.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ah yes but do you know what is also coming up?&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Sam? &ldquo;Come on! You know my birthday!&rdquo; said Char, &ldquo;Well, then happy birthday Char!&rdquo; said Sam, They ran back up the green hill, through the pine tree forest, and into town. In the middle of town was the great tree. One of the biggest trees for miles around, its leaves were golden and silk to the touch. In town they could smell apples, carrots, corn, limes, lemons, and cookies. The apples were from the great tree. Char took one of the greenest juiciest apples on the stand. &ldquo;See you later Char.&rdquo; Said Sam, &ldquo;Ok Bye Sam&rdquo; said Char.  After that Sam decided to go to the local creek, where all the good fishing was. When he got to Winsington creek he got out all of his fishing materials and got to work. After a few minutes (for this creek was full a fish) he felt a pull on the line. He tugged and out came his first fish. Well after a couple hours he had caught ten fish. He lugged the bag home so his mom could make fish for tomorrow. He had time to do what he wanted now so he ran to his favorite tree (the one his dad put a tree fort in). When he got up there he saw something unusual it was dark clouds gathering in the distance yet they didn&rsquo;t seem like clouds more of a wisp. &ldquo;Ah yes now I remember.&rdquo; Said Sam, black clouds means fire. &ldquo;Hmm, I wonder what they are doing over there if it is a someone&#8230; or a something.&rdquo; Said Sam. He dreaded the thought that it could possibly be a forest fire. It would probably mean the destruction of Winsington creek and the town! The next day he met Char again in town. &ldquo;Hey Char we have to get to making the decorations for the Calamite festival.&rdquo; Said Sam, &ldquo;All right where to?&rdquo; said Char, Sam said, &ldquo; Lets get over to my house.&rdquo; Down the dirt road they met their neighbor Rosa who loved keeping sweet smelling flowers in her front yard. Right now there were red roses in the garden. She saw them looked up and said, &ldquo;Well hello! Where you off to so quick?&rdquo; Char said, &ldquo;Well we get the honor to host the festival of the sword of Calamite; and we have to go home to get ready!&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am going to the next village to sell flowers.&rdquo; Said Rosa, &ldquo;Ok, bye Rosa!&rdquo; said Sam.  When Sam and Char arrived at the house they could smell potatoes, carrots, bread, and chicken. Sam heard his mom cooking in the kitchen. He had a mother but no father; she told him that his father had gone missing in the wilderness. Sam said, &ldquo;Wow! That looks mouth watering!&rdquo;  Sam and Char ran upstairs to start making the decorations, his dog, Amicus, was sleeping by Sam&rsquo;s bed. About an hour later they where done with decorations for the day. Sam said goodbye to Char and went to bed for the night. He curled up in the covers hugged Amicus Goodnight and went to sleep.</p>

<p> Chapter 2   He woke up to the smell of bacon, eggs, and biscuits floating up from the kitchen. He smiled, knowing that his mother had made his favorite breakfast. He got dressed and went down stairs to eat breakfast. When he got down there he saw his mother cooking breakfast and his dog trying to sneak a piece of bacon. Sam walked over to the plate of food and started eating his food. Amicus started whining, so he dropped a piece of bacon for him. His mother said, &ldquo;Good morning Sam, how was last night?&rdquo;  Sam said, &ldquo;It was good, we finished most of the decorations for the party.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud that my own son gets to host the party for the sword of calamite.&rdquo; His mother looked like she was going to say something else but she didn&rsquo;t.  He finished his breakfast, said goodbye to his mother, and walked out the door. He stopped on the way to the village at Char&rsquo;s house and knocked on the door. Char answered the door and Sam said, &ldquo;Lets go down to the village.&rdquo; They were walking on the way when they passed Rosa&rsquo;s house Sam said, &ldquo;Lets see if she&rsquo;s home.&rdquo; Sam knocked, Rosa&rsquo;s Mother answered the door, &ldquo;Why hello Sam, Char. Are you looking for Rosa?&rdquo;  Sam said, &ldquo;Yes, is she home?&rdquo; Rosa&rsquo;s mother said, &rdquo;No I&rsquo;m sorry, she went to Mocksville to sell her flowers.&rdquo;  Sam thought, &ldquo;Oh yes, I forgot about that.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Ok, well thanks Mrs. Bloomer.&rdquo; Sam and Char continued on there way to the village when Char asked, &ldquo;Sam, do&#8230; do you like&#8230; Rosa?&rdquo; Sam was surprised by this question and for a second didn&rsquo;t say anything. Then Sam said, &ldquo;Well&#8230; I mean I&rsquo;ve known her for a while&#8230; and we are friends&#8230; so yes&#8230; I guess I like her.&rdquo; Sam knew that wasn&rsquo;t the answer Char was looking for, but he didn&rsquo;t want to tell Char just yet. When they arrived at the village they bought all the supplies they needed for the rest of the decorations and continued home. When they were almost home the mayor walked up to him and said in a nervous voice, &ldquo;Sam you&rsquo;d do whatever I asked you right? You wouldn&rsquo;t do anything against my will right?&rdquo;  Sam said, &ldquo;Uh yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything against you.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s mood changed to his old jolly self again, &ldquo;Good boy, well good luck!&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said Sam.  When they got home Sam immediately said, &ldquo;Well that was weird.&rdquo; Char was silent. Then went upstairs to continue making the decorations. Char was going to stay at their house for a few days to help complete the decorations. They stayed up till midnight until they finally went to bed.  In the morning Sam got up, got dressed, and went down stairs to eat. When everyone had sat down at the table Sam Started to speak when there was a knock on the wooden door of their house.  Sam said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; At the door there was a man (rare around there) he said, &ldquo;Hello my name is Hominis I&rsquo;m here to look for the diamond of Eldor he left it around here.&rdquo; Sam said, &ldquo;No you must be mistaken. There is no diamond of Eldor around here.&rdquo; &ldquo;NO! It has to be here! The map led me here! I just don&rsquo;t under&#8230; Wait what is that? &ldquo;Um&#8230; the emblem of the sword of Calamite.&rdquo; Said Sam, &ldquo;It looks just like the picture on the back of my map!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;But the sword of Calamite was lost to a dragon many years ago!&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I must get the sword!&rdquo; said the stranger, The man ran out of the house down the dirty road and out of town. &ldquo;Well that was weird,&rdquo; said Sam.  &ldquo;Come on. Lets get inside and start preparing.&rdquo; Said Char &ldquo;Ok, lets go.&rdquo; Said Sam.  While they where making and planning the celebration, Sam accidentally ripped a paper in half.  &ldquo;What are you doing Sam!&rdquo; said Char  &ldquo;Sorry I was thinking about that man.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well stop thinking about him and get moving!&rdquo; &ldquo;It just seems weird that he has to do something with the celebration of the sword of Calamite.&rdquo; Said Sam  &ldquo;Well there won&rsquo;t be a celebration if you don&rsquo;t get moving!&rdquo; said Char  &ldquo;OK! I will.&rdquo; Said Sam.  Then once they were done they ran to the town square and went to a party their friend Siegen was hosting. &ldquo;Well hello, How is the decorating going?&rdquo; &ldquo;Pretty good. But Sam keeps lollygagging.&rdquo; Said Char  &ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo; Said Sam  &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s ok just party for now and have fun!&rdquo; said Siegen  &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; Said Sam  That night they felt like they would fall asleep on the way home. That was how tired they were.  Chapter 3   In the morning they started on the work of preparing. Then they heard commotion outside. The mayor was on a stand he said, &ldquo;Hominis, the man who came here yesterday, was killed by the dragon. This is why we don&rsquo;t go on crazy adventures.&rdquo; The crowd gasped. &ldquo;That is not the only bad news. The great tree is starting to die and if we don&rsquo;t find out why soon&#8230; it will die&rdquo; Then the mayor got down and left.  &ldquo;Well that was crazy news.&rdquo; Said Char  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe him.&rdquo; Said Sam  &ldquo;About what?&rdquo; said Char &ldquo;About the man. I just have a feeling he is alive.&rdquo; Sam and Char went back home and slept. Sam woke up in the middle of the night. He had decided that he would go and find the man. He grabbed some food and water, his backpack, and a knife his father gave him. He wrote a note, left it on the table, and ran out the door. In the morning Char came out and was looking for Sam when he saw a note on the table, it said,  &ldquo;I have gone out to save the man. Yours truly Sam.&rdquo; Char was devastated,  &ldquo;Oh no why did he do that! He&rsquo;s crazy we never go out on hopeless quests! And he left me here to do the party planning!&rdquo; Sam was in the forest on his way to the mountain of fire. That was the mountain of the dragon. He had a feeling that the mayor lied and that the man was alive. Sam thought about the adventure ahead. For a minute Sam didn&rsquo;t think it was real. He said to his self, &ldquo;What am I doing? Why am I saving this man?&rdquo; then he thought, &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&rdquo;  When Sam got to the mountains everything was quiet. No birds were singing and no trees sighing. All of the animals seemed to be sleeping, holding their breath as if something big was about to happen. He was walking by some rocks with moss and lichens all over them when he saw something move on the cliff and heard a crash. He turned around to see what it was when all of a sudden everything went black. He woke up and looked around. His vision was blurry so he couldn&rsquo;t see much except blurry images that looked like rocks. Then he felt his head; &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; his head had a bump on it. &ldquo;Must have been a rock slide started by some animal,&rdquo; said Sam. While his eyes started getting adjusted he saw where he was. He was still in the mountains but it was dark out. Not the best time to be in the mountains. When he looked around he saw what had happened; there was a rock about the size of his hand that hadn&rsquo;t been there that morning or at least he thought it hadn&rsquo;t been there.&rdquo; Great.&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Now I have less time to get to the sword.&rdquo; Sam just realized what he had just said. &ldquo;I just said to get the sword but I set out to save the man.&rdquo; Even though he had said it puzzled him, it had just come out! As he picked up the rock there was something out of the ordinary about it, but he couldn&rsquo;t figure out what. After that by looking closer he saw that it wasn&rsquo;t a rock but a big piece of metal painted like a rock. &ldquo;This means only one thing. Someone had done this and done it on purpose.&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;The question is who?&rdquo; Well he got up and started going again when he felt dizzy. His head was still throbbing from were it was hit. He got up again but he blacked out once more. When he woke up and got going again the moon was all ready half way through the sky. In fact the moon was a full moon that night, his face laughing at how long he had slept. Just to make sure he didn&rsquo;t get knocked silly he said his name, &rdquo;Sam Truman.&rdquo; He looked around again, and then out of the darkness he saw a cave. It had a couple small stalactites and stalagmites, &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; He thought, &ldquo;shelter for the night.&rdquo; he checked to see if there were any wild animals in the cave. There wasn&rsquo;t; &ldquo;Well now I have a place to sleep.&rdquo; It worried him to think of a wild animal coming back to the cave while he was sleeping. So he didn&rsquo;t sleep much at night with those thought. When he woke up he was freezing, &ldquo;What was I thinking, sleeping on rock at night. I could have been frozen!&rdquo; Because if you know anything about rocks you know they will suck the heat right out of you. Well it was morning and with all of the fears of night gone he felt ready to do anything. &ldquo;Now all I have to do is eat something.&rdquo; he looked in his pack but all the food was gone! &ldquo;Oh great that&rsquo;s what happened last night! I guess I&rsquo;ll have to find some.&rdquo; When he picked up the rock he noticed that words were written on the rock now that it was light, also it wasn&rsquo;t a rock but a piece of metal! It said, &ldquo;Darkness shall find you! -Chaser&rdquo; that confirmed it. Someone was hunting him, and that someone was named Chaser and Chaser wanted him dead. Or was he named Chaser? It was capitalized but it could just be that he is a chaser. While he was walking he came by a statue of Calamite, he looked at the name, &ldquo;Calamite Dex Truman.&rdquo; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; He thought, &ldquo;Calamite&rsquo;s a Truman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chapter 3   Mrs. Julie Truman woke up; it was the morning that Sam had left. Charlie (Mrs. Truman always called him Charlie) hadn&rsquo;t told her about Sam leaving. While she was doing her household cleaning, she was just getting to Sam&rsquo;s room when she noticed Sam was gone. She assumed he had gone to the market. When she saw Sam&rsquo;s bed she thought otherwise. The note Sam had left was there. After she had read it, she was in tears. She knew that Sam would sooner or later go after the sword. After all Calamite was his ancestor.   Power; he wanted more, he needed more. Malum felt the need for revenge. Darkness was all he could see. Calamite, the one who entombed him, Malum felt anger and self-pity. He wanted to kill Calamite, but what could he do? Calamite was all ready dead. Ah yes an heir, he needed an heir to Calamite. Then he saw light, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said. The tomb was open.   While Malum was walking out of the tomb he thought about Calamite&rsquo;s last name. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember it&rsquo;s on the tip of my tongue.&rdquo; Well Malum kept going when he noticed he was coming up on Calamite&rsquo;s grave. &ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;That I was buried next to Calamite.&rdquo; He went next to the grave and blew the dust off the tombstone.&rdquo; Truman.&rdquo; that was Calamite&rsquo;s last name. Malum said, &ldquo;Now all I have to do is track down his heir from the last name.&rdquo; He kicked open the tomb, he wanted to see Calamite&rsquo;s face. But the grave was empty. With that information Malum kept going up. When he got out of the cave he looked around. Then he picked up the nearest thing that looked like a good weapon. Which happened to be a knife, he didn&rsquo;t know it but there were swords lying around. He walked up a dirt road that looked as if it was barely used by anybody. After a couple hours of walking he came upon a village. A villager saw him and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with your cloths? It looks as if you just came from the middle ages.&rdquo;  Then Malum said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I am.&rdquo;  The villager said, &ldquo;Oh yes that&rsquo;s a nice one pal&#8230; COUGH! CHOKE!&rdquo;  Malum said, &ldquo;I am not your pal.&rdquo;  Then the villager said, &ldquo;OK OK.&rdquo; Malum walked into a tavern and walked toward the most dangerous looking guy. That guy was named Chaser, a dangerous criminal. He told Chaser he would pay him 2000 tokens (their way of money) if he would find and kill an heir of Calamite with the last name of Truman. He accepted the offer to earn money greedily.   Chaser decided to look at the local villages citizen logs. On the way there he grabbed an apple from a farmers tree. The farmer saw him but knew that the criminal was not to be trifled with. Chaser was glad that the farmer didn&rsquo;t bother him. When he got to the towns log, the log didn&rsquo;t have a Truman in it. Well that was it for this town he now had 20 miles between him and the next village. &ldquo;This better be worth it.&rdquo; Thought Chaser, on the way to the village he stumbled on an old shack. In the shack he found old food and a note to Sam Truman! &ldquo;Hmm, this must be the Truman I am looking.&rdquo; Now all he had to do was find the village with the man named Sam Truman lived in. But of course Sam was only thirteen but it wouldn&rsquo;t take him long to find out.   After traveling for 2 days he only 1 mile to go. On the way to the village he saw a farmer with a cart full of lemons. Then Chaser asked, &ldquo;Does a man by the name of Sam Truman live here?&rdquo;  The farmer said, &rdquo;No but there is a boy by that name.&rdquo; Chaser was confused at first but then his eyes lit up. It was going to be easier to kill him now or so he thought. When he got to the village he went straight to the house that the farmer had told him that Sam Truman lived at. But when he got there he was in for a surprise. He knocked on the door and a lady appeared. Chaser said, &ldquo;Does a Sam Truman live here?&rdquo;  The lady at the door said, &ldquo;Yes but he is not here now.&rdquo; Then Chaser said, &ldquo;Well then where is he?&rdquo; Julie Truman said, &ldquo;He is&#8230;&rdquo; she hesitated, should she tell this man where Sam is? No she had better not.  So she said, &ldquo;He is at his grandma&rsquo;s house on a holiday.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s its with this lady.&rdquo; Thought Chaser and left; he knew that she was lying by the way that she had hesitated but he had learned something, Sam was not at is grandma&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p> Chapter 4    With the notion of Calamite being his ancestor Sam continued along the path to the volcano. After walking along the path for a while he came upon an apple tree. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;Now I have some food for my journey!&rdquo; He stuffed his backpack full of apples and kept going, but only after eating a few apples. On the way up he saw a figure and for a moment he thought it was Hominis but it was a man with his wife. When Sam walked up to him and the man introduced himself as Petra. Sam asked him, &ldquo;Have you seen a man named Hominis around here?&rdquo; then Petra said, &ldquo;Yes he came to our house for a map through the volcano. I don&rsquo;t know how he knew but I used to have it, now it&rsquo;s in at the library.&rdquo; Sam was about to keep going but Petra stopped him. &ldquo;You can come to my house for a little bit, I want to talk about it.&rdquo; When they got to the house Petra asked him, &ldquo;What do you know about Hominis?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I know he went out to find the diamond of Eldor, that my mayor didn&rsquo;t like him, and that he seemed a bit anxious.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; Thought Petra, &ldquo;That makes sense you may go now.&rdquo; Then Sam left. &ldquo;Well that was a weird visit.&rdquo; Thought Sam.   Soon Sam came upon a canyon, at the bottom of the canyon he found a rock with the words &ldquo;Ne in hac via, ignis et terra, hisi velis ut perspicatis.&rdquo; He tried hard to remember what language it was&#8230; all of a sudden he remembered it was latius. He translated the words to be, &ldquo;Do not continue on thy path unless thou wish to encounter fire and earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo; thought Sam, &ldquo;Its just a volcano.&rdquo; And continued on the path. Sam did not know the danger he was walking into.  When Sam was walking up he saw someone coming over the hill in front of him. It was Rosa! Sam ran up to her and asked here what she was doing here. &ldquo;Sam, don&rsquo;t you remember that I was selling flowers?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, now I remembered. So did it go well?&rdquo; Said Sam, &ldquo;Yes they don&rsquo;t have flowers over by the volcano so they disappear pretty fast.&rdquo;  Suddenly Char came running around the corner and met them. All out of breath Sam and Rosa couldn&rsquo;t understand what he was saying they tried to calm him down but they couldn&rsquo;t. Then Char shouted, &ldquo;THE VILLAGE HAS BEEN DESTROYED! The only people that survived was me, this guy named Chaser, and the mayor&#8230; I wish the mayor didn&rsquo;t survive.&rdquo; Said Char &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Rosa &ldquo;Because Sam was right, the mayor is evil.&rdquo; Said Char &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say he was that evil.&rdquo; Said Sam, &ldquo;YES HE IS! HE KILLED YOUR MOTHER AND THEN HIM AND THIS GUY NAMED MALUM DESTROYED THE VILLAGE!&rdquo; said Char, Sam fell to the ground in shock; he couldn&rsquo;t believe what Char had just told him. Rosa had also fallen to the ground crying. The fire that Sam had saw before leaving Winsington Creek was a fire set on purpose! Now Sam was faced with a decision, a decision to keep going or to go back and find the mayor and make him pay for what he has done. Sam looked up, something was wrong Rosa was looking past Sam at something. Sam turned around. There was the mayor! Sam turned around ran towards the mayor; the mayor tried to stab Sam but only cut him on the arm. Then Sam looked at the mayor, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to stab him. He let him go, but he knocked him out first. The mayor fell to the ground knocked out. Sam said to Rosa and Char, &ldquo;Lets go&#8230;&rdquo;  They didn&rsquo;t question him at all and walked away with him to the volcano. Having no choice other wise. &ldquo;Well, I guess I don&rsquo;t have a hard decision any more.&rdquo; Thought Sam.</p>

<p></p>

<p> Chapter 5   Chaser couldn&rsquo;t believe that Malum had just tried to kill him. &ldquo;Hmm maybe I should join that Sam kid instead of listening to this lunatic.&rdquo; Said Chaser.  &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; said Malum, &ldquo;Uh&#8230; what I&#8230; I didn&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo; &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Malum. Then Malum stabbed him through the heart. &ldquo;I have no need of him anymore&#8230; I think it would be better if I just killed Sam myself. Then he would know I am his killer and that I wont stop on my revenge to extinguish the Truman&rsquo;s from this earth! With that done Malum walked away from the town, with the great tree burning in the middle. He had now already killed two of the Trumans, Sam&rsquo;s mother and his father! He was not immediately inclined to deal with Sam yet though; first he would get all the items he needed and then destroy Sam with them forever.   While walking on the path Sam, Char, and Rosa came across an old castle the entrance to the castle had a door with an inscription on it. Sam remembering the story's told at their village, said, &quot;Hey, this is the lost kingdom.&quot; Supposedly it was owned by Calamite and while he was alive the kingdom prospered. Then an evil man named Malum wanted Calamite&rsquo;s wealth for himself. So Malum raised an army of men and other immortals like himself. Calamite's army defeated Malum's because Calamite had a magical sword that could kill the immortals. Calamite spared Malum only to put him in a living grave were he would suffer. Malum came close to death but Calamite kept him alive. The worst torture of all. Finally Malum used a spell to make it looked like he was dead. When Calamite left Malum came out of the cave and cursed Calamite's castle. When Calamite found out he asked a servant to give him poison and went to kill Malum. In the story Malum is killed but on the inscription it said that the poison was actually a sleeping potion. So Calamite only thought Malum was dead; but he lived on. It all made sense now Malum, was trying to kill him because his ancestor was Calamite. That was why Malum destroyed his village, that was why Malum killed his mom, and why Malum wanted to kill him! &quot;We have to keep going!&quot; Said Sam, Char and Rosa followed him and kept going. They left the ruined castle behind and entered the dark forest. Where many had lost their way and died, including his ancestor Calamite had died in this forest. The story says that Calamite ran into the forest and was attacked. His servants went in and to find him and found him dead on the ground. Nobody knows who did it but people believed that a servant went into the forest with him and killed him. The servants went to tell everyone but when they came back his body was gone. Thus passes away a great hero.  Sam, Char and Rosa came up on a great city. It was one of the biggest settlements in the country. Malum was walking away from the village when he found the mayor crawling toward him, &ldquo;I did what you said Malum&#8230; I did it.&rdquo; He said in a raspy voice. Malum came up to him. The mayor said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my payment?&rdquo; Malum came up to him he said, &ldquo;The feeling of betraying everyone in this village is your payment!&rdquo; then the mayor said, &ldquo;What?!? No you promised a payment!&rdquo; Then Malum came up to the mayor and put his foot on the mayor&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your payment!&rdquo; Said Malum, He choked the mayor to death.</p>
